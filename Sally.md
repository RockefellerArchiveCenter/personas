# Sally

## Job/role description

Sally has **worked at RAC for over ten years**, and knows some
collections very well. Although she doesn’t mind using online search
tools, she often **prefers to use paper finding aids** because she is
familiar with them and they represent the structure of the collections
in a way that she understands.

Sally spends most of her time working with researchers. She
**corresponds** with potential researchers in order to schedule their
visit and to determine what materials they would like to look at while
they are at RAC. She helps researchers **create a list of material** to
look at – sometimes suggesting relevant material based on her subject
knowledge – and **prepares that material** prior to the researcher’s
visit. Once the researcher arrives onsite, she **registers** them and
then follows up after they leave, **managing requests** for duplication,
publication permission and citations.

She would like to lighten her workload by **sending digitized materials
to researchers**, particularly those who are simply requesting **copies
of a particular item or contents of a folder**.

## Hardware and software used

Sally has a Windows 7 desktop computer with multiple monitors at work,
and a laptop running Windows 7 at home. Her preferred browser is Mozilla
Firefox.

## Working locations and hours

Although she mostly works at RAC during regular business hours, Sally
will occasionally respond to researchers on evenings and weekends from
home.
