## Job/role description

Tom is the **personal accountant** for Richard Richardson, one of the
RAC’s **individual donors**. He is preparing Mr. Richardson’s **tax
documents** and needs to know the **cost of a Picasso painting** his
client purchased several years ago. He has **no idea where this
information is** in Mr. Richardson’s records, but he is sure it is
somewhere in his financial records, which are **restricted from
research**. Tom **has never been to the RAC** and is completely
**unfamiliar with archival description, policies and practices**.

Since he has worked with Sally in the past, Tom **emailed her directly**
to ask if she could find this information for him. In the past, when he
has made such requests, she has **dropped everything and looked for the
information he requested right away**, so he expects that the same thing
will happen this time.

Tom needs a **copy of the receipt** or other document that lists the
price for the painting, and would **prefer to receive it via email**
rather than waiting for mail or courier delivery.

## Hardware and software used

Tom uses an iMac as his primary computer, but also accesses the internet
using his iPhone. His preferred browser is Safari.

## Working locations and hours

Tom generally works from his home office and usually keeps regular
business hours.
