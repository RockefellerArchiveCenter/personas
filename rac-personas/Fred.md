## Job/role description

Fred **works in public relations** at the Foundation for Sustainable Giving, one of the RAC’s **donor institutions**. He needs a **high-resolution copy of an archival photo** for inclusion in a promotional brochure that is **set to go to the printer in several hours**. Although he has visited the RAC in the past and **has some sense of the scope and organization his institution’s records**, he **has never performed archival research, and is unfamiliar with archival description**. As an employee of a donor institution, Fred can access materials that are restricted from researcher use, and which may not be even minimally described or processed.

Because he has worked with her in the past, Fred **emailed Sally Smith directly** and asked her to help him fulfill this request. He **does not have time to come to RAC** and find the photograph himself.

Fred would like to be able to **browse digitized photographs** from **his institution’s collection** so he can pick out the best one and **download a high-resolution copy**. Because of the nature of his work, **time is of the essence** to Fred, and he needs answers to his questions as soon as possible. 

## Hardware and software used

Fred uses a desktop computer running Windows 7 at work, but also checks email and accesses the internet on his Blackberry. His preferred browser is Internet Explorer 10.

## Working locations and hours

Fred works long hours and sometimes works on the weekend if the need arises. His job requires him to travel to events almost constantly, so he is infrequently at his desk for long periods of time.
