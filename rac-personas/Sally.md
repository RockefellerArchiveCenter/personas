## Job/role description

Sally has **worked at RAC for over ten years**, and knows some collections very well. Although she doesn’t mind using online search tools, she often **prefers to use paper finding aids** because she is familiar with them and they represent the structure of the collections in a way that she understands.

Sally spends most of her time working with researchers. She **corresponds** with potential researchers in order to schedule their visit and to determine what materials they would like to look at while they are at RAC. She helps researchers **create a list of material** to look at – sometimes suggesting relevant material based on her subject knowledge – and **prepares that material** prior to the researcher’s visit. Once the researcher arrives onsite, she **orients them and reviews the RAC's policies and procedures**. Once the researcher has completed their research visit, she continues to **manage their requests** for duplication, publication permission and citation information.

She would like to lighten her workload by **sending digitized materials to researchers**, particularly those who are simply requesting **copies of a particular item or contents of a folder**. She would also like to **keep track of questions she's answered in the past** and wants to **group digitized material in ways that make sense to her**.

## Hardware and software used

Sally has a Windows 7 desktop computer with multiple monitors at work, and a laptop running Windows 7 at home. Her preferred browser is Mozilla Firefox.

## Working locations and hours

Although she mostly works at RAC during regular business hours, Sally will occasionally respond to researchers on evenings and weekends from home.
