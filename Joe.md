## Job/role description

Joe has **worked at RAC under two years**, and has limited knowledge of the collections. **He prefers to use online search tools** because he finds paper guides clunky and out of date.

Joe works in a number of different areas. He does shifts in the reading room, where he **helps researchers identify and request material**. He also **retrieves material** and **fulfills duplication requests**. In addition, he does some preservation reformatting and rehousing, and occasionally **makes minor changes to existing description** to reflect those activities.

He would like to **know what material has been digitized**, so that he can **direct researchers to that material** if it is publicly available, or **send it to researchers who have requested digital copies**. Joe wants to **apply his own set of tags to digital material** so that he can find and use that material at a later date. He would also like to **share digital material he finds interesting on social media**.

## Hardware and software used

Joe has a Windows 7 desktop with single monitor at work. His preferred browser is Google Chrome.

## Working locations and hours

Joe does not work from home or outside of regular business hours.
