## Job/role description

Joe has **worked at RAC under two years**, and has limited knowledge of
the collections. **He prefers to use online search tools** because he
finds paper guides clunky and out of date.

Joe works in a number of different areas. He does shifts in the reading
room, where he **helps researchers identify and request material**. He
also **retrieves material** and **fulfills duplication requests**. He
also does preservation reformatting and rehousing, and occasionally
**makes minor changes to existing description** to reflect those
activities.

He would like to **know what material has been digitized**, so that he
can **direct researchers to that material** if it is publicly available,
or **send it to researchers who have requested digital copies**.

## Hardware and software used

Joe has a Windows 7 desktop with single monitor at work. His preferred
browser is Google Chrome.

## Working locations and hours

Joe does not work from home or outside of regular business hours.
