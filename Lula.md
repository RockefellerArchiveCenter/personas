## Job/role description

Is a **Ph.D. student writing her dissertation** on models of philanthropy in post World-War II Europe. She has visited many archives
before and is **familiar with archival description, policies and procedures**.

Lula was **personally** **referred to RAC** by one of her professors at the University of Bologna, who has researched here in the past. Lula then **sent an inquiry through the main RAC website**.

Lula plans to spend five days at RAC doing onsite research. Because she **has limited time and funding**, she wants to **look at as much material as possible** while she is here. Often, she will take photos of material so she can **read and evaluate it later**. She is **primarily interested in archival material**, but may be interested in seeing some of RAC’s **books if they are not widely available** elsewhere.

If material that is **specific to her research** has already been digitized, Lula would like to **access it from home**, so she does not have to spend time looking at that material while she is at RAC. She would like to save citation information for materials relevant to her research, and would prefer to be able to **download descriptive metadata as well as digital records in bulk** so she can run text mining software on the documents.

## Hardware and software used

Lula primarily uses a Macbook Air, but also accesses the internet on her Android tablet and her iPhone. Her preferred browser is Safari.

## Working locations and hours

Lula works at all hours of the day (and night). Although she often works at her university’s library, she frequently works in coffee shops or other locations with free wireless internet access.
